# 📘 Magento SEO FAQs - jQuery Accordion

This project is a clean and responsive FAQ section implemented using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **jQuery**. It follows an accordion style where only one FAQ answer opens at a time for better user experience.

## ✅ Features

- Only one FAQ open at a time
- Plus ➕ and minus ➖ icon toggle
- Responsive layout (mobile-friendly)
- Clean, modern styling using Google Fonts

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- [jQuery 3.7.1](https://jquery.com/)
- Google Fonts (Open Sans)

## 🧠 How It Works

- Each question has a `.faq-title` with a click event.
- When clicked:
  - The related answer `.faq-content` is toggled.
  - All other open answers are closed.
  - The `+` icon changes to `–` and vice versa.
