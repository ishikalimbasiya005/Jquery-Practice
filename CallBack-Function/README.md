# 📁 Callback Function Example in jQuery

This project demonstrates the use of a **callback function** in jQuery, combined with **CSS styling and animations**.

## 🔍 What is a Callback Function?

A **callback function** is a function that is executed **after another function has finished execution**.

In jQuery, it's commonly used with animation methods like `.hide()`, `.show()`, `.fadeIn()`, `.slideUp()`, etc., to run some code **after the effect completes**.

## 🧪 How it Works

- A colored box is displayed on the screen.
- When you **click** the box:
  1. It hides using `.hide(1000, callback)`
  2. After hiding, the **callback** changes its color via `.css()`
  3. Then the box is shown again
